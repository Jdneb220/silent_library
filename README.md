#Silent Library
##Weekend project GA WDI
##Ben, Liz, Ray


We've started our project from this template from Bucky Roberts: https://github.com/buckyroberts/angular-2-template

### Install Libraries and Dependencies

`npm install`

### Run the Project

`npm start`

Now you can start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and run lite-server with automatic refreshing.
